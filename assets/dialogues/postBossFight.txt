Wizard: (The wizard lies defeated, his staff shattered. The knight stands over him, breathing heavily. The wizard coughs blood, grinning weakly.)
Wizard: (Choking laugh) "You fool... Even if you free her... this kingdom is already dead. The people? Broken. The royal bloodline? Extinct. What's left to save?"
Knight: (Kneels beside him, voice steady) "You never understood. It was never about thrones or bloodlines. It was about them." (Gestures to the distant survivors) "Their hope isn't yours to take."
Wizard: (Eyes widening, then fading) "Hope...? Heh. How... pathetic." (Dies)
Knight: (The knight sheathes his sword and turns toward the tower. Distant cheers of survivors echo as he ascends to free the princess.)
