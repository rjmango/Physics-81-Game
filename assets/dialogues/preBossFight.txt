Knight: (The Nameless Knight stands at the entrance to the wizard's tower, sword drawn. The wizard descends, his staff crackling with dark energy.)
Wizard: "Ah, the traitor returns! Tell me, did you really believe you could sneak past me? That I wouldn't sense your treachery?"
Knight: "I didn't come to sneak. I came to end this."
Wizard: (Mocking laughter) "End this? You? A broken man who once slaughtered innocents beside us? The princess doesn't need saving. She needs to witness the death of hope!"
Knight: (Grips sword tighter) "You're right. I was a monster. But you? You're worse. You don't just kill bodies. You kill souls. That ends today."
Wizard: (Smirks, raising his staff) "Then let's see whose soul breaks first."
Wizard: (The wizard unleashes a storm of dark magic. The fight begins.)
