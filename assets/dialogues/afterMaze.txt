Both: The knight bursts through the final hedge, sword gleaming in the sunlight.
Knight: The wizard stands on the other side of a deep chasm, the stone bridge between them crumbling into the abyss.
Wizard: Ah, you made it! How delightful.
Knight: Enough games, wizard! Face me!
Wizard: With a flick of his staff, the wizard causes thick vines to sprout from the cliffside, dangling across the gap.
Wizard: Very well. Let's see if your bravery extends to... heights.
Knight: The knight glares, sheathing his sword to grip the vines. As he begins climbing, the wizard chuckles, watching him struggle against the swaying, treacherous path.
Knight: (grunting) You fight like a coward!
Wizard: And you climb like an ox. How charming.
Knight: Just as the knight reaches the middle, the vines twist unnaturally, nearly throwing him off. He barely holds on, muscles straining.
Wizard: Oh dear. Did I forget to mention? The vines are... alive.
Knight: The knight growls and pushes forward, finally hauling himself onto the opposite ledge. He draws his sword, panting, but the wizard simply steps back, smirking.
Wizard: Congratulations! You've earned... the privilege of watching me leave.
Wizard: With a dramatic wave, a swirling portal opens behind him.
Knight: You won't escape!
Wizard: I already have.
Wizard: The wizard steps backward into the portal, his laughter echoing as it vanishes.
Wizard: The knight is left alone on the cliff's edge, the wizard's distant castle taunting him across miles of cursed wilderness.
Knight: (clenching his fist) This isn't over.
Knight: He turns, staring down the long, treacherous path ahead. 
Knight: The wizard's mocking voice still ringing in his ears.
