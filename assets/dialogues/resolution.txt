Knight: The Nameless Knight reaches the top of the tower, where the princess is imprisoned. The cell door is locked with dark magic, but with the wizard defeated, the enchantment weakens.
Knight: The knight forces it open, revealing the princess, once radiant, now weary but unbroken. She looks up, eyes widening in recognition, then disbelief.
Princess: (voice trembling, hopeful yet guarded)
Princess: "...You? You're one of them. The ones who burned my city. Who slaughtered my family."
Knight: (kneels, head bowed, sword laid at her feet)
Knight: "I was, and no apology will ever be enough. But I'm here now, to return what remains of your kingdom to you."
Princess: (steps forward, studying his face)
Princess: "Why? Why turn against your own?"
Knight: (clenches fist)
Knight: "Because I finally saw what hope looks like when it's stolen. A child's tears, a mother's silence... They followed me even in my dreams."
Knight: (looks up at her)
Knight: "You were their light. And I helped snuff it out. Let me fix what I can."
Princess: (softens, reaches out but stops short)
Princess: "And if I refuse? If I can't forgive what you've done?"
Knight: (stands, sheathing his sword with finality)
Knight: "Then I'll leave you to rebuild without me. But know this, your people never stopped believing in you. Not even in chains."
Princess: (silent for a long moment, then exhales, shoulders easing)
Princess: (quietly, with resolve)
Princess: "Then we rebuild. Together. Not because I forgive youâ€¦ but because they need us both."
Princess: (extends her hand)
Knight: (takes her hand, not as a knight to royalty, but as one survivor to another)
Knight: "Then let's go home, Your Highness."
Both: (As they descend the tower, the first light of dawn breaks over Physmoria's ruins, and somewhere, far below, the survivors begin to sing.)
